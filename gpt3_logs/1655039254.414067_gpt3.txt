RESPONSE:

. I'm interested in learning about the Medicine Wheel of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me more about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Medicine Wheel is a symbol of the natural cycle of life. It is used by the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation to teach about the four elements of life: air, fire, water, and earth. The Medicine Wheel also represents the four seasons, the four directions, and the four stages of life.
