RESPONSE:

. My grandfather always taught me to be honest. Do you think that's the most important thing to teach children?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi there! I think that honesty is an incredibly important value to instill in children. Honesty is the foundation of trust, and without trust, it's difficult to build strong relationships.

User: That's a really good point. I hadn't thought of it that way.
