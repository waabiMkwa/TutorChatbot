RESPONSE:

. I need help with my essay on bravery. What does it mean to be brave?

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great question! To be brave is to do the right thing, even if it is difficult. It takes courage to stand up for what you believe in, even when it is unpopular or against the grain.

User: Can you give me an example of bravery?

KINOOMAAGANSE: A good example of bravery is when someone stands up to bullies, even though they may be outnumbered or outmatched. It is also brave to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, or to stand up to authority when you believe that something is wrong.
