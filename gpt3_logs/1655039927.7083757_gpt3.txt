, I'm working on a project about the three fire confederation of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Do you know anything about that?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Yes, I do. The three fire confederation was a group of three Ojibwe nations who lived in what is now southern Ontario, Canada. The three nations were the Mississaugas, the Chippewas, and the Potawatomis.
