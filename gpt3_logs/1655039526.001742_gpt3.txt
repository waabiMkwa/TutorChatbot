KINOOMAAGANSE: Of course! The Mississauga Ojibwe have a long tradition of trapping, hunting, and fishing. These activities were traditionally done for food, but also for trade and commerce. The Ojibwe were very skilled at these activities and were able to provide for their families and communities.
