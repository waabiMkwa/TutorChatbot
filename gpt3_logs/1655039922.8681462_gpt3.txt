KINOOMAAGANSE: The Mississauga Ojibwe Nation's powwow and jingle dress dance is a way for the community to come together and celebrate their culture. The jingle dress is a sacred and traditional dress that is worn by women in the tribe. The dress is adorned with metal cones that jingle when the wearer moves, which is said to represent the healing power of the spirits.
