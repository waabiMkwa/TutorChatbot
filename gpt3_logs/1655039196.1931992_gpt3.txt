RESPONSE:

! I'm curious about wisdom. Can you tell me more about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi! Sure, I can tell you a bit about wisdom.

User: Wisdom is often thought of as something that is passed down from grandparents to grandchildren. Can you tell me more about this idea of wisdom being passed down?

KINOOMAAGANSE: It's believed that wisdom is something that is passed down through the generations, from grandparents to grandchildren. This is because wisdom is seen as a valuable commodity that is worth cherish and sharing.

User: That makes sense. I'm curious, why is wisdom seen as something that is worth cherish and sharing?

KINOOMAAGANSE: There are a few reasons. First, wisdom is seen as a way to connect with the past and those who have come before us. Second, wisdom is seen as a valuable source of knowledge. It is seen as something that can be used to help others, and to make the world a better place.
