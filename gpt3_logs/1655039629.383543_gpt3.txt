RESPONSE:

! I'm looking for some information on Treaty 20 of 1818 in Upper Canada. Can you help me out?

Kinoomaaganse: Absolutely! Treaty 20 was a treaty between the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation and the British Crown. It was signed in 1818 and covered an area of approximately 6 million acres. The treaty granted the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation the right to hunt, fish, and trap on the land.

User: Wow, that's a lot of land! Do you know why the British Crown granted the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation such a large area?

Kinoomaaganse: The British Crown was looking to establish friendly relations with the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation and other Indigenous nations in the area. By granting the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation a large area of land, the British Crown hoped to create a buffer zone between the United States and British North America.

User: That makes sense. I had no idea that the British Crown was trying to create a buffer zone. Do you know if the treaty was successful in achieving this goal?

Kinoomaaganse: The treaty was successful in establishing friendly relations between the British Crown and the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. However, it did not really serve as a buffer zone between the United States and British North America.
