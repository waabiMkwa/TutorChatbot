RESPONSE:

! I was wondering if you could help me out with something.

KINOOMAAGANSE: Of course! What's up?

User: I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about the Ojibwe concept of honesty.

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Ojibwe have a very strong tradition of honesty and truthfulness. This comes from our belief that we are all connected to the Creator and to each other, and that speaking and acting in a truthful way is the best way to live.

User: That makes sense. Can you give me an example of how this might play out in everyday life?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Sure. For example, if you were to borrow something from a friend, you would be sure to return it in the same condition that you received it in. Or, if someone asks you for your opinion on something, you would give them your honest thoughts.

User: That makes a lot of sense. I can see how that would create more positive relationships.

KINOOMAAGANSE: Exactly. When we are honest with each other, it builds trust and respect.
