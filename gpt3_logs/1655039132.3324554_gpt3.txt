RESPONSE:

, can you tell me about the wigwams of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi! Sure, the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation is a First Nation located in southern Ontario. Their wigwams were made of cedar bark and saplings, and were usually oval or conical in shape.

User: Interesting! Do you know why they used cedar bark?

KINOOMAAGANSE: There are a few reasons! Cedar bark is durable and weather-resistant, so it was a good material for building homes. It's also lightweight, so it was easy to transport.

User: That makes sense. Do you know how the Mississauga Ojibwe built their wigwams?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Yes, the Mississauga Ojibwe would start by creating a frame of saplings. Then, they would weave cedar bark between the saplings to create the walls of the wigwam. The final step was to cover the wigwam with a tarp or animal hide to keep out the weather.
