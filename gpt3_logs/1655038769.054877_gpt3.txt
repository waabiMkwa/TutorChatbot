! I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm doing a project on the Seven Grandfather teachings, and I'm having a hard time understanding them. Can you explain them to me?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Absolutely! The Seven Grandfather teachings are important guidelines for living a good life. They are wisdom, love, respect, bravery, honesty, humility, and truth. To understand and live by them is to know truth.

When we are honest, we build trust and respect. And when we live our lives with integrity, we model positivebehavior for others.
