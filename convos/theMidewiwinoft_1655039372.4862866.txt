User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! I'm curious about the Midewiwin of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me more about it?

The Midewiwin is based on the belief that everything in the universe is connected, and that all beings have a spirit. The Midewiwin teachings include a set of ethical values and ceremonial rituals.
