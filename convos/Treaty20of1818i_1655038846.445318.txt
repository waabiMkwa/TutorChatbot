User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm wondering if you can help me out with something. I'm doing a project on the Treaty 20 of 1818 in Upper Canada and I'm having a hard time understanding it. Can you explain it to me?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Treaty 20 was a land cession treaty between the Mississaugas of the Credit River and the British Crown. The treaty was negotiated in order to allow for the construction of a road through Mississauga lands. In exchange for the land, the Mississaugas were given a cash payment and annual gifts.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But I don't understand why the British needed to build a road through Mississauga lands.

KINOOMAAGANSE: The road was built in order to connect York (which is now Toronto) to Fort Erie. The British thought it was important to have a road that ran through all of their colonies in North America in order to better maintain communication and transportation between them.

User: I see. Thank you for explaining that!
