User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm curious about the Dreamcatcher of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me more about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Of course! The dreamcatcher is a tradition of the Ojibwe people. It is a hoop with a web made of sinew or yarn, sometimes decorated with beads and feathers. The dreamcatcher is hung above a baby's cradle to protect them from bad dreams.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea. Do you know why the dreamcatcher is used specifically by the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Mississauga Ojibwe are one of many First Nations in Canada who have adopted the tradition of the dreamcatcher. The dreamcatcher is thought to originate from the Anishinaabe people. The Mississauga Ojibwe likely adopted the tradition from their neighbours, the Anishinaabe.
