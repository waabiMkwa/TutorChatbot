User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE. I have a question about the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation.

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi there! What would you like to know about the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation?

User: Well, I was reading about the three fire confederation and I was curious about its formation.

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great question! The three fire confederation was formed in the 1600s when the Mississauga, Chippewa, and Ottawa peoples joined together. The main reason for the confederation was to better resist the encroachment of the French and British colonizers.

User: Why did they choose those three groups specifically?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Good question! The three groups were all located in close proximity to each other and shared similar cultures and languages. Additionally, the Mississauga and Chippewa had already had a long history of alliances and relationships.
