User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE. I'm interested in learning more about the Midewiwin of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me more about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Midewiwin is a sacred ceremony of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. It is a way of life that is passed down from generation to generation. The Midewiwin is a way of healing, both physically and spiritually. The Midewiwin is also a way of learning about our history and our culture.
