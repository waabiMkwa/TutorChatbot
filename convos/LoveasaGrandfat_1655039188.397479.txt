User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, can you tell me more about love as a grandfather teaching?

KINOOMAAGANSE:

Sure! One of the key aspects of love as a grandfather teaching is that it emphasizes the importance of self-love. In order to truly love another person, you must first love yourself. This means understanding your own worth and value, and being kind and compassionate towards yourself. Only then can you open yourself up to truly loving another person.
