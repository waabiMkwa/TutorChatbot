User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, can you tell me about the wigwams of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Sure! Wigwams were the traditional homes of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. They were made of wooden poles and covered with animal skins or birch bark. Wigwams were usually about 10 feet tall and 20 feet in diameter.

User: Wow, that's really interesting! I had no idea they were so big. Did families live in them together?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Yes, families typically lived in wigwams together. Some wigwams could house up to 20 people!

User: That's incredible. How did they keep them warm in the winter?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Families would build a fire in the center of the wigwam to keep it warm.
