User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm Mississauga Ojibwe and I'm curious about our birch bark canoes. Do you know anything about them?

KINOOMAAGANSE:

Yes, I certainly do! The birch bark canoe is an important part of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation's history and culture. Can you tell me what you specifically would like to know about them? I'd be happy to share what I know.
