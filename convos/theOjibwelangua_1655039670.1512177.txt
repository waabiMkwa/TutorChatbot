User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! I'm really interested in learning more about the Ojibwe language. Do you know anything about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE:

Yes, I do! The Ojibwe language is spoken by the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation, and is a part of the Algonquian language family. It's a beautiful language, and I'm happy to share what I know about it with you!
