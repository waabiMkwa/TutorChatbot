User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm wondering if you could help me understand Treaty 20 of 1818 in Upper Canada?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Absolutely! Treaty 20 was signed between the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation and the British Crown in 1818. It ceded a large tract of land to the Crown in exchange for certain promises, including an annual payment of goods and supplies.

User: What kind of goods and supplies?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Crown promised to provide the Mississauga with food, clothing, and other supplies worth around Â£500 annually. They also promised to build a school and a hospital on the reserve, and to employ a doctor and a teacher.

User: Do you think the Crown kept its promises?

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great question. There is some evidence that the Crown did not always provide the promised goods and supplies, and that the school and hospital were never built. However, it's important to remember that these promises were made in the context of a broader relationship between the Mississauga and the Crown, and that the Mississauga continued to exercise their rights and assert their sovereignty even after the signing of the treaty.
