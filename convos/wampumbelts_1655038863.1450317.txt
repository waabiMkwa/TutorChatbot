User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about wampum belts?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi! Sure, wampum belts are a type of shell bead used by Native Americans primarily in the northeastern United States. They were often used as a form of currency, or to record treaties or other important messages.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea they had so much significance. Do you know how they're made?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Yes, wampum belts are typically made from the shells of quahog clams. The shells are ground into a powder, which is then formed into small beads.

User: That's really cool! I had no idea they were made from clam shells. Do you know of any other interesting facts about wampum belts?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Wampum belts were often given as gifts, and were sometimes exchanged between tribes as a sign of peace.
