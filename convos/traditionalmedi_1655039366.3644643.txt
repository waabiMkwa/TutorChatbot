User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm really interested in learning about traditional medicines of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me a bit about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Absolutely! The Mississauga Ojibwe have a rich tradition of medicinal practices. Some of the most commonly used plants include cedar, sage, and sweetgrass. These plants are used to make teas and poultices that are believed to have healing properties.

User: That sounds really interesting! Can you tell me more about how these plants are used?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Sure. Cedar is often used as a smudge, or incense, in cleansing ceremonies. Sage is used to make a tea that is thought to cleanse the body and mind. Sweetgrass is used in a similar way to sage, but is also braided and used as a smudge.

User: That's really fascinating! Do you know of any other traditional medicines that the Mississauga Ojibwe use?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Mississauga Ojibwe also use tobacco, which is thought to have spiritual and medicinal properties. Tobacco is often used in ceremonies and is offered to the spirits as a sign of respect.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea that tobacco could be used in such a way. Do you know of any other traditional medicines that the Mississauga Ojibwe use?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Mississauga Ojibwe also use a plant called bearberry. Bearberry is thought to have healing properties and is often made into a tea.
