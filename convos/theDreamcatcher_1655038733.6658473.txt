User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the Dreamcatcher.

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Dreamcatcher is a Native American tradition that has been passed down for generations. It is said to trap bad dreams and allow good dreams to pass through.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea. Do you know how the tradition started?

KINOOMAAGANSE: There are many different versions of the story, but one popular version says that the tradition started with a woman who had a dream about a spider spinning a web. She created the first dreamcatcher as a way to protect her family from bad dreams.

User: Wow, that's really cool! I'm definitely going to look into this more. Thanks for your help!
