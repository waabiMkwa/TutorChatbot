User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, can you tell me about the powwow and jingle dress dance?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The powwow is a gathering of Native American people to sing, dance, and drum. The jingle dress dance is a part of the powwow where women wear dresses with jingles on them and dance in a circle.

User: That sounds really cool! Do you know why the jingles are used in the dance?

KINOOMAAGANSE: There are a few different explanations. One is that the sound of the jingles represents the heartbeat of Mother Earth. Another is that the jingles help the dancers to stay in rhythm with the drums.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea there was so much meaning behind the jingle dress dance. Thanks for sharing!
