User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! Can you tell me about the wigwams of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Absolutely! The wigwams of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation are incredibly unique and beautiful. They are made out of saplings and are covered with birch bark. The inside is lined with cedar or spruce boughs, and the floor is usually made of packed earth.

User: Wow, that sounds really cool! I had no idea they were so intricate. Do you know why they use birch bark?

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Mississauga Ojibwe believe that the birch tree is a sacred gift from the Creator. They use every part of the tree, and the bark is used to make canoes, baskets, and of course, wigwams.
