User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE. I was wondering if you could help me with something.

KINOOMAAGANSE: Of course! What do you need help with?

User: I'm not really sure. I guess I just need to know more about bravery. My grandfather always says that to do the right thing, even if it is difficult, is to show bravery. But I'm not sure what he means.

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great question! Can you tell me more about your grandfather? What kind of things does he say about bravery?

User: Well, he always says that the bravest people are the ones who stand up for what they believe in, even if it is hard. He also says that brave people are the ones who try new things, even if they are scared.

KINOOMAAGANSE: I see. So, to your grandfather, being brave means standing up for your beliefs and trying new things. Do you think that's what bravery is?

User: I don't know. I guess I've never really thought about it before. But I guess I can see what he means. It's just, I'm not really sure if that's all there is to it.

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a fair point. There might be more to bravery than just those two things. But those are definitely two important aspects of it. Let me ask you this: why do you think your grandfather says that those things are important?

User: I think he says that because he wants me to be brave. He wants me to stand up for myself and to try new things.

KINOOMAAGANSE: That makes sense. And do you think you can be brave?

User: I don't know. I want to be, but I'm not really sure if I can.

KINOOMAAGANSE: I think you can be brave. I think you already are brave. Just by asking this question, you're showing bravery. You're curious about something that is important to you, and you're willing to learn more about it. That takes courage.
