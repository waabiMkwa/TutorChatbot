User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm interested in rock art and the art history of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation. Can you tell me more about it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Rock art is a type of art that is created by carving or painting images onto rocks. The Mississauga Ojibwe Nation is a group of Native Americans who live in the area that is now known as Toronto, Canada. The Mississauga Ojibwe have a rich history of creating art, including rock art. Some of the most famous Mississauga Ojibwe rock art sites include the Petroglyphs at Peterborough, which feature more than 900 carvings, and the Cup and Ring Marks at Credit River, which feature more than 200 carvings.
