User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! I'm really interested in wampum belts. Can you tell me more about them?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Absolutely! Wampum belts are traditional Native American belts made of shells. The belts were used for trading, and as a form of currency. Wampum belts were also used as a form of storytelling, and as a way to record history. Do you have any specific questions about wampum belts that you would like me to address?
