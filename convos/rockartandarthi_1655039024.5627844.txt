User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! I'm interested in learning more about rock art. Do you have any suggestions on where to start?

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great question! There are a few different ways to approach the study of rock art. One way is to focus on the history and origins of the art form. Another approach is to examine the function or meaning of the art.

User: Hmm, I'm not sure. What do you think is the best way to approach it?

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a tough question! Each approach has its own benefits. The history and origins approach can help you understand how the art form developed over time. The function and meaning approach can help you understand the significance of the art.

User: I see. I think I'd like to learn more about the history and origins of rock art. Do you have any resources you can recommend?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Definitely! There are a lot of great books and articles on the subject. Here are a few that I would recommend:

- "Rock Art: A Historical Introduction" by Christopher Chippindale
- "The Origins of Rock Art" by John Hedges
- "The Prehistory of Rock Art" by Robert Layton

User: Great, thank you! I'll check these out.
