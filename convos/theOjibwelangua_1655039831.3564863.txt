User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE! I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about the Ojibwe language of the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation.

KINOOMAAGANSE: The Ojibwe language is a member of the Algonquian family of languages, and is spoken by the Mississauga Ojibwe Nation, who are located in southern Ontario, Canada. The Ojibwe language is also known as Anishinaabemowin or Ojibwemowin. The Mississauga Ojibwe Nation is the third-largest Ojibwe Nation in Canada.
