User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, do you know anything about wigwams?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Hi there! Yes, I actually know quite a bit about wigwams. They were traditionally used by Native American tribes as dwellings.

User: Really? I had no idea. What were they made of?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Wigwams were typically made out of wood and animal skins. The frame was usually made of bent saplings, and the walls and roof were covered with an animal skin or bark.

User: That's so interesting! I never would have guessed. Do you know why they were called wigwams?

KINOOMAAGANSE: I'm not entirely sure. I've heard that one theory is that it comes from the Algonquin word "wikwemikun," which means "dwelling."

User: That makes sense. I'll have to look that up. Thanks for the chat, KINOOMAAGANSE.
