User: Hey KINOOMAAGANSE, I'm struggling to really understand what wisdom is. Can you help?

KINOOMAAGANSE: Of course! What would you like to know about wisdom?

User: Well, I know it's supposed to be some kind of knowledge that you can't get from books... but that's about it.

KINOOMAAGANSE: That's a great place to start! What do you think wisdom is, then?
